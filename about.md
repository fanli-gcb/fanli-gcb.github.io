## About Me


I am currently a Senior Statistician (read: computational biologist) in the lab of [Dr. Grace Aldrovandi](https://www.uclahealth.org/grace-aldrovandi) at UCLA. My research is focused on development and application of computational methods for analysis of metagenomic data. These days, I work extensively on integrative approaches utilizing multi-omics datasets to understand how host-microbe interactions influence human health and development.

I also have a part time role as a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist with the [SC<sup>2</sup> Core](https://www.chla.org/research/single-cell-sequencing-and-cytof-sc2-core-laboratory) at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, doing RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, 16S/metagenomics, WGS, WES, etc. 

I did my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/index.shtml" target="_blank">Genomics and Computational Biology</a> at the University of Pennsylvania Perelmann School of Medicine under the mentorship of Drs. <a href="http://web.sas.upenn.edu/gregory-lab/" target="_blank">Brian Gregory</a> and <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/wanglab/" target="_blank">Li-San Wang</a>. I developed sequencing-based methods to characterize RNA secondary structure and RNA-protein interactions at a genome-wide level. I also developed a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to predict RNA secondary structure from these genome-wide assays.
